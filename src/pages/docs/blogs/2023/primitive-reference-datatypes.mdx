JavaScript uses two types: primitive (simple data) and reference (objects, which are memory references). Unlike some languages, JavaScript treats primitives like references. It manages variables using a variable object, storing primitives directly and referencing objects' memory locations. Despite initial similarities, primitives and references behave differently. Many other distinctions exist between them
