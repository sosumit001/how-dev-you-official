# Getting start with Async/Await

## Async functions
Normal functions use <i>return</i> to provide a result. By adding <i>async</i>, any function can become asynchronous, and async functions return <i>Promise</i> instead of direct results
<Highlighter
	codeString = {`//normal function
const fn = () =>  {
	return "Hello, World"
}

//asynchronous function
const asyncFn = async () => {
	return "Hello, World"
}
`}
	language = "javascript"
/>
## How to use the Promise
 In an async function, there's a result that it eventually provides. This result is stored in something called a Promise. You can think of a Promise like a special box that holds the result. To open this box and see what's inside, you use a function called 'then'. When you use 'then', it's like opening the box
<Image
	src = {asyncJs_00}
	alt = "asyncJs 00"
 />
To get result from an <i>async function</i> use, <i>.then()</i> method, a callback function inside<i>.then()</i> method holds the result of asynchronous function i.e 

<Highlighter
	codeString = {`const asyncFn = async () => {
 return "Hello, World"
}
asyncFn().then((res) => {
 console.log(res)
 // "Hello, World"
})
asyncFn()
`}
	language = "javascript"
 />

 ## The await keyword
  The <i>await</i> keyword is used inside an <i>asynchronous function</i>, allows you to assign the result of a resolved <i>Promise</i> directly to a variable

  <Image
	src = {asyncJs_01}
	alt = "asyncJs 01"
 />

  When you use <i>await</i> inside an <i>async function</i>, it pauses the function until a task is finished. Even though you don't see <i>.then()</i>, JavaScript is still using it behind the scenes. This makes your code look like it's running step by step

  ## Async function example

  Async functions are incredibly useful when dealing with tasks that take some time to finish, like <i>fetching data from a website</i>, <i>waiting for a response from a server</i>, or <i>performing any operation that involves waiting</i>. They allow us to write code in a way that looks synchronous, even though it's actually asynchronous under the hood. 
  
  Now, let's see how we can put this to work with an example using <i>Puppeteer</i>

  <i>Puppeteer</i> is developed by the Google Chrome team, is a headless Chrome Node.js API can perform tasks like <i>web scraping</i>, <i>automated testing</i>, <i>and taking screenshots of web pages</i>, all programmatically

Taking a screenshot of a webpage is only a few lines of code 

<Highlighter
	codeString={`import puppeteer from 'puppeteer'
import fs from 'fs'

const browser = await puppeteer.launch()
const page = await browser.newPage()
const res = await page.goto('https://blog.sumitso.in/')
const img = await page.screenshot()
await browser.close()

fs.writeFileSync('sumitsowebblog.png', img)`}
language="javascript"
/>

This code hides a lot of complexity. It starts a browser, then sends
commands to it, all asynchronous since the browser is a separate process.
But the end result is an image buffer containing the screenshot

Now, Let's break it down

# Promises

So far we've discussed how to write Promise-producing async functions and
how to wait for a Promise to have a value. But how to create Promises in
cases where there are no existing Promises to build on?

To know this, we need to discuss how asynchronicity works in Javascript
and how to construct Promises from callbacks

But first let's discuss a little more about <i>callbacks</i>

## Callbacks

Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions. They are executed after the function they are passed to completes its task.
They are commonly used in asynchronous operations like <i>setTimeout</i>, <i>AJAX requests</i>, and <i>event handling</i>. 

For example, when you use setTimeout, you pass a callback function that will be executed after a certain period of time.

<Highlighter
	codeString={`setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('This will be executed after 2 seconds.')
}, 2000)`}
	language="javascript"
/>

The problem with callbacks is that we are back to square one as instead of
having a flat structure we have nesting again

Fortunately, there is a simple way to convert callbacks to Promises and then
use them with await

## The Promise constructor

Async functions return Promises, allowing you to use <i>await</i> for waiting on results. To create a Promise, use its constructor along with a callback function that signals when the result is ready.

For instance, to convert setTimeout into a Promise, wrap it in the constructor and use <i>res</i> as the callback:

<Highlighter
	codeString={`await new Promise((res) => {
 setTimeout(res, 1000)
})
`}
	language="javascript"
/>

With Promises instead of callbacks it's easy to use await and make a
sequence of async operations
## Promise states

A Promise starts in a <i>Pending state</i>, waiting for completion.
If successful, it's <i>Resolved</i>, allowing the program to continue. If there's an error, it's <i>Rejected</i>.
<i>Both Resolved and Rejected states are considered Fulfilled</i>

	alt = "asyncJs 03"

# Error handling

In real-world situations, errors can occur. With async functions, handling errors is crucial. If not handled properly, errors can halt the flow of code.

Just like with synchronous functions, you can use try-catch to handle errors in async functions. Errors that occur during await are caught and can be handled using familiar syntax.

<Highlighter
	codeString={`const fn = () => {
 throw new Error("Something bad happened")
}
try {
 fn()
}catch(e) {
 // handle error
}
`}
	language="javascript"
/>

Remember, errors in async functions are thrown during the await and not when the function is initially called

<Highlighter 
	codeString = {`const asyncFn = async () => {
 throw new Error("Something bad happened")
}
const res = asyncFn() // no error here
try {
 await res // error
}catch(e) {
 // handle error
}
`} 
	language = "javascript"
/>
