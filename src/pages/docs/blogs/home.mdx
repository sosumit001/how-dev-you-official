# <code>Hi there!</code> ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my space on the internet. <code>I'm Sumit So</code>, and I like to talk about programming stuff.
I make videos on YouTube about programming. You can check them out [here](https://youtube.com/@howdevyou). I also do some coding on [GitHub](https://github.com/sosumit001). Feel free to take a look.

I write articles about programming. Some are easy, some are a bit harder. But I try to make them useful for everyone.
Sometimes, I talk about programming in different places. If you're interested, you can find more about that here.
